\outcome{Understand how polynomials behave and how their graphs look.}

\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
   In this set of videos, we will work to understand how 
   polynomials behave and how their graphs look.  
%  In this set of videos, we will work to understand
%  composition of functions, including evaluation 
%  of composition of functions through function 
%  notation and graphs, building compositions of functions
%  recognition a function composites.
