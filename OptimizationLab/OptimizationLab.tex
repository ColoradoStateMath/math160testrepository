\maketitle

\hspace{2cm}In class we explored a problem that involved finding the optimal dimensions for a rectangular pen that maximizes its area. Recall that the solution when all four sides of the pen will be built from a limited amount of fencing is a square. In this lab we will examine what happens if we are not restricted to a rectangle, but build the pen as a regular polygon with n sides. Our goal is finding the optimal number of sides to use when building a pen.\\

%%%%%% Area of an n-sided regular polygon
\hspace{2cm}To optimize the area of an n-sided regular polygon we will need a function that represents the area of the polygon. One way to do this is to split the polygon into smaller, more manageable pieces. Since we are working with a regular polygon (A polygon whose sides and angles are all the same size), a natural choice is to cut it into triangles from the center as in the figure below.

\begin{problem}
How many triangles will an n-sided polygon split into? $\answer[given]{n}$.

How large is the angle $\theta$ for an n-sided polygon? $\answer[given]{\pi/n}$.

What is the area of the blue triangle in terms of $n$ and $r$? $\answer[given]{r^2\sin(\pi/n)\cos(\pi/n)}$.

Then what is the total area of an n-sided regular polygon in terms of $n$ and $r$?\\
Area $=\answer[given]{(n)(r^2)\sin(\pi/n)\cos(\pi/n)}$.

\end{problem}

\bigskip

\hspace{2cm}Recall when finding the optimal dimensions for the bunny pen in class we found an area formula in terms of two variables. We wished to find the derivative, so we needed to rewrite the formula in terms of only one variable. We used the fact that the length of fencing was limited in order to write one variable in terms of the other. Let's try the same strategy here.\\
\hspace{2cm}Let $P$, a constant, be the length of fence that we can use to build the pen. Refer back to the triangle diagram to compute the perimeter of the polygon in terms of $n$ and $r$.

\begin{problem}
$P = \answer[given]{2(r)(n)\sin(\pi/n)}$.

Since we're keeping the perimeter $P$ constant, we can solve for $r$...

$r = \answer[given]{P/(2(n)\sin(\pi/n))}$.

...and use it to rewrite area in terms of $n$.

$A(n) = \answer[given]{P^2\cot(\pi/n)/(4n)}$.

\bigskip

What is the domain of $A(n)$? 

\wordChoice{\choice{real numbers}\choice[correct]{integers}} \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{greater than or equal to}\choice{less than or equal to}} $\answer{3}$.

\begin{freeResponse}
In order to use calculus to find extreme values we need the function to be differentiable, which means it must at least be defined and continuous on an open interval. If we treat $A(n)$ as being defined on real numbers will any maximums or minimums we find still be maximums and minimums when we restrict $n$ to the integers? Why or why not?
\end{freeResponse}

\bigskip

\hspace{2cm}Now that we have $A(n)$ in terms of one variable we're ready to find the derivative! It may be helpful to simplify your formula for the area first. Rewrite it so that it only has one trig function.

You will want to be able to copy and paste the derivative for later use. Write it in a separate text document, and paste it into the answer box below to check your work.

$A'(n) = P^2\,\answer[given]{((4\pi/n)\csc^2(\pi/n)-4\cot(\pi/n))/(16n^2)}$.

\end{problem}

\bigskip

\begin{problem}
\hspace{2cm}Yikes! Ok, that's a beast, but let's not lose our heads. We're hunting critical points after all. Where can critical points occur?
\begin{selectAll}
    \choice[correct]{Where $A'(n_0)$ is zero, for an interior point of the domain of $A(n)$.}
    \choice{At endpoints of the domain of $A(n)$.}
    \choice[correct]{Where $A'(n_0)$ does not exist for an interior point of the domain of $A(n)$.}
    \choice{Where $A(n_0)$ is zero for an interior point of the domain of $A(n)$.}
\end{selectAll}
\end{problem}

\bigskip

\begin{problem}
Notice $A'(0)$ and $A'(1)$ do not exist. Are $n=0$ and $n=1$ critical points?
\begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{Yes, if $A'(n_0)$ does not exist then $n_0$ is a critical point.}
    \choice{Yes, if $A'(n_0)$ does not exist then $n_0$ is a critical point.}
    \choice{No, $n=0$ and $n=1$ are not critical points because they are not in the domain of $A'(n)$.}
    \choice{No, $n=0$ and $n=1$ are not critical points because $A'(0) \ne 0$ and $A'(1) \ne 0$.}
    \choice[correct]{No, $n=0$ and $n=1$ are not critical points because $n=0$ and $n=1$ are not in the domain of $A(n)$.}
\end{multipleChoice}
\end{problem}

\bigskip

\hspace{2cm}Now to see if $A'(n)=0$ anywhere. This equation can't be solved algebraically, but let's persist! After all, algebra is not our only tool! Use the Desmos widget to plot a graph of $A'(n)$.

Enter the derivative you computed earlier. (You may need to retype "pi" if desmos does not interpret it as $\pi$.)

\[
\graph[panel]{y=}
\]

\begin{problem}
Where is $A'(n)=0$?

\begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{$A'(n)=0$ at $n=50$.}
    \choice[correct]{$A'(n)$ is never zero, it is always positive for $n>=3$.}
    \choice{$A'(n)$ is never zero, it is always negative for $n>=3$.}
\end{multipleChoice}
\end{problem}

\bigskip

\begin{problem}
So we found $\answer{0}$ critical points.\\
Can $A(n)$ have any extreme values?\\
\begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{No, extreme values always occur at critical points.}
    \choice{No, $A(n)$ is always increasing so there cannot be any extreme values}
    \choice{Yes, $A(n)$ can have a maximum at $n=0$}
    \choice[correct]{Yes, extreme values can occur at endpoints too.}
\end{multipleChoice}
\end{problem}

\bigskip

\begin{problem}
Since $A'(n)$ is always \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{positive}\choice{negative}}, $A(n)$ is always \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{increasing}\choice{decreasing}}.\\
\smallskip
At the endpoint $n=3$ $A(n)$ has a \wordChoice{\choice{local maximum}\choice[correct]{local minimum}\choice{neither a max or a min}}\\
\smallskip
Intuitively, do you think that as $n \to \infty$ $A(n)$ can \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{increase}\choice{decrease}} without bound? \wordChoice{\choice{yes}\choice[correct]{no}}.\\ %%This could be interesting to look at. Does a 'yes' indicate a lack of intuition or a lack of motivation?
\end{problem}

\medskip

\begin{problem}
Let's investigate! Hints are provided if you need them.\\
\[\lim_{n \to \infty}A(n) = \answer{P^2/(4(\pi))}\]
\begin{hint}
	It may be helpful to rewrite $A(n)$ in terms of sine and cosine:\\ $A(n) = \frac{ \answer{P^2\cos(\pi/n)} }{ \answer{4n\sin(\pi/n)} }$.
\end{hint}
\begin{hint}
    What is the limit of the numerator? \[\lim_{n \to \infty} P^2\cos(\frac{\pi}{n}) = \answer{P^2}\]
\end{hint}
\begin{hint}
  Now consider the denominator. Recall \[\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sin(h)}{h} = \answer{1}\]
\end{hint}
\begin{hint}
  Can we manufacture a denominator for $sin(\frac{\pi}{n})$ that matches the inner function $\frac{\pi}{n}?$\\
  \[4n\sin(\frac{\pi}{n}) = 4(\frac{1}{1/n})\sin(\frac{\pi}{n}) = \frac{4\,\answer{\pi}\,\sin(\frac{\pi}{n})}{\answer{\pi/n}}\]
\end{hint}
\begin{hint}
     Then \[\lim_{n \to \infty} 4n\sin(\frac{\pi}{n}) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{4\pi\sin(\frac{\pi}{n})}{(\frac{\pi}{n})} = \answer{4\pi}.\]
\end{hint}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
What does this limit mean? Remember $A(n)$ represents
\begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice[correct]{The area of an n-sided regular polygon}
    \choice{An n-sided regular polygon}
    \choice{The perimeter of an n-sided regular polygon}
\end{multipleChoice}
\begin{freeResponse}
As $n$ approaches infinity, what happens to the shapes represented by $A(n)$?
\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
What shape has maximal area for a fixed perimeter $P$?
\begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{A triangle}
    \choice{A parabola}
    \choice{A square}
    \choice[correct]{A circle}
\end{multipleChoice}
\end{problem}

\bigskip

\begin{problem}
If $P = 4\pi$ then \[\lim_{n \to \infty} A(n) = \answer{4\pi}\].\\
\begin{freeResponse}
Does this answer make sense with respect to the shape that you think maximizes the area for a fixed perimeter? Explain.
\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem}
