Two young mathematicians discuss what curves look like when one
``zooms out.''

Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true
story):

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Riley, think about this function:
  \[
  f(x) = \frac{1}{x}.
  \]
\item[Riley] Hmmm. If you plot it, the graph looks like this:
  \begin{image}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \begin{axis}[
          samples=100,
          axis lines =middle, xlabel=$x$, ylabel=$y$,
          every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
          every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
        ]
	\addplot [very thick, penColor, smooth,domain=-10:10] {1/x};
        \addplot [very thick, penColor, smooth,domain=-10:10] {1/x};
      \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{image}
\item[Devyn] Right! What I've noticed is that if $x$ gets really big or really small, then
  our function looks like a line.
\item[Riley] Yeah!  And also if the $x$ values get really close to $0$, our function also looks like a different line! 
\item[Devyn] Whoa!  You're blowin' my mind. 
\end{dialogue}

\begin{problem}
Devyn and Riley have noticed that the function $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ looks like a horizontal line $y \ = \answer{0}$ for $x$ values far away from $0$ and looks like the vertical line $x \ = \answer{0}$ for $x$ values near $0$.  
\end{problem}
