%% Vertical Asymptote 1
\begin{exercise}
Your goal in this exercise is to evaluate $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to -3} \frac{1}{(x+3)^3}$ (if it exists).  First, consider the corresponding one-sided limits:

$$\lim_{x \to -3^-} \frac{1}{(x+3)^3} \text{ and } \lim_{x \to -3^+} \frac{1}{(x+3)^3}.$$

As $x$ approaches $-3$ from the left:  

\begin{itemize}

\item The function $1$ approaches $\answer{1}$, which is a \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{positive}\choice{negative}} number. 

\item $(x+3)^3$ is \wordChoice{\choice{positive}\choice[correct]{negative}} and approaches $\answer{0}.$ 

\end{itemize}

Therefore, 

 \[ \lim_{x \to -3^-} \frac{1}{(x+3)^3} = \answer{-\infty}.\]
 
As $x$ approaches $-3$ from the right: 

\begin{itemize}

\item The function $1$ approaches $\answer{1}$, which is a \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{positive}\choice{negative}} number. 

\item $(x+3)^3$ is \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{positive}\choice{negative}} and approaches $\answer{0}.$ 

\end{itemize}

Therefore, 

 \[ \lim_{x \to -3^+} \frac{1}{(x+3)^3} = \answer{\infty}. \]

Putting all of this information together, you can conclude that

\[ \lim_{x \to -3} \frac{1}{(x+3)^3} = \answer{DNE}. \]

\begin{exercise}

From the above limit calculations, you can say that $\frac{1}{(x+3)^3}$ \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{does}\choice{does not}} have a \wordChoice{\choice{horizontal}\choice[correct]{vertical}} asymptote at $x =-3$. 

\end{exercise}

\end{exercise}

%% Vertical Asymptote 2
\begin{exercise}
Your goal in this exercise is to evaluate $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to 7} \frac{-3x+2}{(x-7)^6}$ (if it exists).  First, consider the corresponding one-sided limits:

$$\displaystyle\lim_{x \to 7^-} \frac{-3x+2}{(x-7)^6} \text{ and } \displaystyle\lim_{x \to 7^+} \frac{-3x+2}{(x-7)^6}.$$

As $x$ approaches $7$ from the left:  

\begin{itemize}

\item The function $-3x+2$ approaches $\answer{-19}$, which is a \wordChoice{\choice{positive}\choice[correct]{negative}} number. 

\item $(x-7)^6$ is \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{positive}\choice{negative}} and approaches $\answer{0}$.

\end{itemize}

Therefore, 

 \[ \displaystyle\lim_{x \to 7^-} \frac{-3x+2}{(x-7)^6} = \answer{-\infty}.\]
 
As $x$ approaches $7$ from the right: 

\begin{itemize}

\item The function $-3x+2$ approaches $\answer{-19}$, which is a \wordChoice{\choice{positive}\choice[correct]{negative}} number. 

\item $(x-7)^6$ is \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{positive}\choice{negative}} and approaches $\answer{0}.$

\end{itemize}

Therefore, 

 \[ \displaystyle\lim_{x \to 7^+} \frac{-3x+2}{(x-7)^6} = \answer{-\infty}. \]

Putting all of this information together, you can conclude that

\[ \displaystyle\lim_{x \to 7} \frac{-3x+2}{(x-7)^6} = \answer{-\infty}. \]

\begin{exercise}

From the above limit calculations, you can say that $\frac{-3x+2}{(x-7)^3}$ \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{does}\choice{does not}} have a \wordChoice{\choice{horizontal}\choice[correct]{vertical}} asymptote at $x =7$. 

\end{exercise}

\end{exercise}

%% Vertical Asymptote 3
\begin{exercise}

Consider the function $f(x) = \frac{x^2+x-6}{x^2-3x+2}$.  The two $x$-values at which $f(x)$ may have a vertical asymptote are

\begin{hint}
On this problem, it will help to factor the numerator and denominator of $f(x)$.

\end{hint}

\begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{$x = -2, 6$}
    \choice[correct]{$x = 1, 2$}
    \choice{$x = -3, 1$}
    \choice{$x = 2, -3$}
    
    \begin{feedback}[correct]
    Good thinking!  For a rational function like $f(x)$, there could be an asymptote at all the $x$ values where $f$ is undefined.  The only way for $f$ to be undefined is if the denominator of $f$ is 0.  Since $x^2 -3x + 2 = (x-1)(x-2)$, the $x$ values that make the denominator 0 are $x = 1, 2$, so these are the potential values at which $f$ may have a vertical asymptote. 
    \end{feedback}
\end{multipleChoice}
    
\begin{exercise}
Now, determine if $x = 1$ and $x = 2$ are asymptotes of $f$ or not. 

As $x$ approaches $1$ from the left:  

\begin{itemize}

\item The function $x^2 + x -6$ approaches $\answer{-4}$, which is a \wordChoice{\choice{positive}\choice[correct]{negative}} number. 

\item $x^2 - 3x + 2$ is \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{positive}\choice{negative}} and approaches $\answer{0}$.

\end{itemize}

Therefore, 

\[ \displaystyle\lim_{x \to 1^-} \frac{x^2+x-6}{x^2-3x+2} = \answer{-\infty} \]

and based on this limit information, you can conclude that

\begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice[correct]{$x = 1$ is a vertical asymptote of $f$.}
    \choice{$x = 1$ is not a vertical asymptote of $f$.}
    \choice{$x = 1$ may or may not be a vertical asymptete of $f$.  There isn't enough information to decide yet.}
\end{multipleChoice}

\begin{exercise}
Alright, now you know that $x=1$ is a vertical asymptote of $f$.  What about $x=2$?  Well, 

\[ \displaystyle\lim_{x \to 2^-} \frac{x^2+x-6}{x^2-3x+2} = \answer{5} \]

and based on this limit information, you can conclude that

\begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{$x = 2$ is a vertical asymptote of $f$.}
    \choice{$x = 2$ is not a vertical asymptote of $f$.}
    \choice[correct]{$x = 2$ may or may not be a vertical asymptote of $f$.  There isn't enough information to decide yet.}
\end{multipleChoice}

\begin{exercise}
Because the limit information we have so far isn't enough to make any conclusions, evaluate the other one-sided limit: 

\[ \displaystyle\lim_{x \to 2^+} \frac{x^2+x-6}{x^2-3x+2} = \answer{5}. \]

\begin{exercise}

Now, from all information you have obtained about the limit of $f(x)$ at $x=2$, you can conclude that 

\begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{$x = 2$ is a vertical asymptote of $f$.}
    \choice[correct]{$x = 2$ is not a vertical asymptote of $f$.}
    \choice{$x = 2$ may or may not be a vertical asymptote of $f$.  There isn't enough information to decide yet.}
    
    \begin{feedback}[correct]
    It turns out that $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to 2} \frac{x^2+x-6}{x^2-3x+2} = 5$ while $f(2)$ does not exist.  This indicates that there is a hole at $x=2$ and not a vertical asymptote!  In fact, if you factor $f(x)$, you'll realize that a factor of $(x-2)$ appears precisely once in the numerator and denominator.  Because of this, when you evaluate $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to 2} \frac{x^2+x-6}{x^2-3x+2}$, the $(x-2)$'s will cancel out, and you'll find that the limit exists.  This kind of 'cancellation set-up' is a tell-tale sign that the function at hand has a hole at $x=2$ rather than a vertical asymptote.  
    \end{feedback}
    
\end{multipleChoice}

\begin{exercise}

Evaluate the limit. 

\[ \displaystyle\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{3x +7 - x^5}{x^4 + 8x^2 -3} = \answer{-\infty} \]

\begin{exercise}

To evaluate the above limit, you had to multiply the numerator and denominator of $\frac{3x +7 - x^5}{x^4 + 8x^2 -3}$ by $\cfrac{1}{x^{\answer{4}}}.$

\end{exercise}

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}

Evaluate the limit. 

\[ \displaystyle\lim_{x \to -\infty} \frac{5x^6 + 3.5x^3 -70x^2 + 2\pi}{3x - \frac{1}{3}x^3+ 6x^6} = \answer{\frac{5}{6}} \]

\begin{exercise}

To evaluate the above limit, you had to multiply the numerator and denominator of $\frac{5x^6 + 3.5x^3 -70x^2 + 2\pi}{3x - \frac{1}{3}x^3+ 6x^6}$ by $\cfrac{1}{x^{\answer{6}}}.$

\end{exercise}

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}

Evaluate the limits. 

\[ \displaystyle\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x - 2x^2 + 3x^3 -4x^4}{7x+5-x^5} = \answer{0} \]

\[ \displaystyle\lim_{x \to -\infty} \frac{x - 2x^2 + 3x^3 -4x^4}{7x+5-x^5} = \answer{0} \]

\begin{exercise}

To evaluate the above limits, you had to multiply the numerator and denominator of $\frac{x - 2x^2 + 3x^3 -4x^4}{7x+5-x^5}$ by $\cfrac{1}{x^{\answer{5}}}.$

\end{exercise}

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}

Evaluate the limit. 

\[ \displaystyle\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\sqrt{2x^2+5}}{-3x} = \answer{-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}} \]

\begin{exercise}

Based on this limit, you can conclude that $\frac{\sqrt{2x^2+5}}{-3x}$ has a horizontal asymptote of $\answer{y} \ = \answer{-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}}$.

\end{exercise}

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}

The function $f(x) = \frac{-1 + 2|x|}{x}$ has a vertical asymptote of $\answer{x} \ = \answer{0}$.  This function also has two vertical asymptotes: One below the $x$-axis, $\answer{y} \ = \answer{-2}$, and one above the $x$-axis, $\answer{y} \ = \answer{2}$.  

\begin{hint}

Use the limit definition of vertical and horizontal asymptote in order to answer this question.  (Yes, that means you'll have to calculate some limits!)

\end{hint}

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}

A function can have a maximum of $\answer{2}$ vertical asymptotes.  

\begin{feedback}[correct]

Could you explain to a fellow classmate why a function can have no more than 2 vertical asymptotes using the limit definition of a vertical asymptote?  

\end{feedback}

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}

Consider the statement below, and then indicate whether it is sometimes, always, or never true.

\begin{center} ``A function, $f(x)$, can have both a vertical and a horizontal asymptote of $x=-3$." \end{center}

This statement is \wordChoice{\choice{sometimes}\choice{always}\choice[correct]{never}} true.

\end{exercise}
