%%Problem 1
\begin{exercise}
Consider 
\[
f(x) = x^2
\]

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the equation of the secant line connecting the point $(1,f(1))$ to the point $(1.1,f(1.1))$? 

The equation of this secant line is
$$ y = \answer{ 2.1x - 1.1}$$ 

\item  Use the definition of the derivative to find the slope of the tangent line to $f$ at $x=1$, and use this to find the equation of this tangent line.

The equation of this tangent line is
$$ y = \answer{2x - 1}$$ 

\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

%%Problem 2
\begin{exercise}
Consider 
\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2}
\]

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the equation of the secant line connecting the point $(1,f(1))$ to the point $(0.9,f(0.9))$? 

The equation of this secant line is
$$ y = \answer{ -2.34568x+ 3.34568}$$ 


\item  Use the definition of the derivative to find the slope of the tangent line to $f$ at $x=1$, and use this to find the equation of this tangent line.

The equation of this tangent line is
$$ y = \answer{ -2x + 3}$$ 

\end{enumerate}

\end{exercise}

%%Problem 3
\begin{exercise}
Consider 
\[
f(x) = \frac{x}{2}+\frac{2}{x}
\]

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the equation of the secant line connecting the point $(2,f(2))$ to the point $(2.1,f(2.1))$? 

The equation of this secant line is
$$ y = \answer{0.0238095x+1.95238 }$$ 

\item  Use the definition of the derivative to find the slope of the tangent line to $f$ at $x=2$, and use this to find the equation of this tangent line.


The equation of this tangent line is
$$ y = \answer{2}$$ 


\end{enumerate}

\end{exercise}
