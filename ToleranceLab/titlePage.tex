\begin{sectionOutcomes}
After completing this section, you should be able to do the following.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Given a `perfect' input value and a given amount of output tolerance, determine the largest amount of input error that guarantees the outputs are in the tolerable range. 
 	\item Given a `perfect' input value and a given amount of output tolerance, determine the interval of inputs that guarantee the outputs are in the tolerable range.
 	\item Given a `perfect' input value and a given amount of output tolerance, determine the largest amount of input error that guarantees the outputs are in the tolerable range. 
    \item Given a particular function and a tolerance situation, label the perfect output, the acceptable output interval, the perfect input, and the input interval that would guarantee the outputs of the function are within the acceptable interval.
    \item Use tables to investigate limits.
    \item Recognize the drawbacks that a table can have in evaluating limits.
    \item Use data tables and graphs to discuss the behavior of a function near a particular $x$ value. 
\end{itemize}
