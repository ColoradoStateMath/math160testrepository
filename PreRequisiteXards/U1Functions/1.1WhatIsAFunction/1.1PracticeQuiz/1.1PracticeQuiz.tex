  \begin{multipleChoice}
      \choice[correct]{Yes, I could find $f(2)$.}
      \choice[correct]{Yes, but I would need to review some resources first.}
      \choice[correct]{No, I would need to learn/relearn how to do this.}
      \choice[correct]{I don't know.}

\begin{problem} 
    Could you find the solutions to $f(x) = 0$ using the graph below?

\begin{problem} 
    Given the function $f(x) = -3x + 2$, could you identify all interpretations of what `$f(2)$' represents?
    
  \begin{multipleChoice}
      \choice[correct]{Yes, I could identify all interpretations of $f(2)$.}
      \choice[correct]{I could identify some interpretations, but I would need to use other resources to determine if the other interpretations were valid or not.}
      \choice[correct]{I know only one interpretation of what  `$f(2)$' represents, and I would need to use resources to find any other interpretations of  `$f(2)$'.}
      \choice[correct]{No, I don't know any interpretations of `$f(2)$', and would need to learn/relearn what these are.
