\vspace{1 in}

A. I answered the questions in order, assuming that the easier ones would come first.

    \begin{multipleChoice}
        \choice[correct]{True}
        \choice[correct]{False}
    \end{multipleChoice}
    
    B. I answered the questions that I knew how to do first.

    \begin{multipleChoice}
        \choice[correct]{True}
        \choice[correct]{False}

    C. I read through all of the questions first before answering any.

    \begin{multipleChoice}
        \choice[correct]{True}
        \choice[correct]{False}
    \end{multipleChoice}
    
    D. After reading a question, I worked backwards and used process of elimination to narrow down my options by checking if the answers were correct.

    \begin{multipleChoice}
        \choice[correct]{True}
        \choice[correct]{False}
    \end{multipleChoice}

        \choice[correct]{True}
        \choice[correct]{False}
    \end{multipleChoice}
    
    F. I used online resources to remind me how to answer the questions, but then solved them myself.

    \begin{multipleChoice}
        \choice[correct]{True}
        \choice[correct]{False}
    \end{multipleChoice}

    \begin{multipleChoice}
        \choice[correct]{True}
        \choice[correct]{False}
    \end{multipleChoice}

    I. I did not use any strategies when completing the pre-quiz.

        \choice[correct]{True}
        \choice[correct]{False}
    \end{multipleChoice}
