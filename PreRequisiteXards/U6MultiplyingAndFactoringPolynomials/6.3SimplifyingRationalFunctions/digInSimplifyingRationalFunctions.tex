\textbf{The following card is still under construction, but it should be complete by the end of the first week of classes.  Hit the update button above around then, and you should see a complete card.  In the meantime you'll find a useful resource for simplifying rational functions \href{https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/rational-expressions-equations-and-functions/simplify-rational-expressions/a/intro-to-rational-expressions}{here}.}
