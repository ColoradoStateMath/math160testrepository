\begin{sectionOutcomes}
After completing this section, you should be able to do the following.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Simplify a rational function (if it can be simplified).
    \item Identify the domain of a rational function before it is simplified and after it is simplified.
    \item Recognize that if a rational function $f$ is simplified to a rational function $g$, then $f \neq g$ as functions. 

\end{itemize}
